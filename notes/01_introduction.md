Agile Design Patterns
=====================

What are Design Patterns?
-------------------------
On October 1994, when four programmers from IBM published a book on Design
Patterns, they became known as the big four. A set of twenty-three problems and
solutions where defined. A design pattern is an accepted solution for a common
problem. Not everyone agrees with them. Some regard some of the design patterns
as anti-patterns. With all this in mind, these patterns are essential knowledge
for an advanced programmer. They are well thought out, accepted, tested, and are
regarded as a low risk solution.

However, since 1994, computers have changed as well as solutions and concepts.
Some updates and variations have changed. As such, Robert C. Martin designed a
book to meet these needs through an agile process.

This course will work through about twenty implementations of Agile Design
Patterns. Each will discuss what it is, how it works, how to implement it, and
when to use it. The heart of a Design Pattern lies in the UML schema. Learn from
the implementations, don't take them literally. Take the schema and then
practice it. Always add your own logic to each pattern to meet the needs of your
project.

UML Basics
----------
The basic elements of UML is a class. This is a simple naming convention. If it
is an interface or an abstract class, it will be noted. The type and the name of
the class will be separated at the top whereas the methods for the bottom. We
can then define our methods as public, protected, or even private. We can also
define them if they receive any parameters or return any type of information.

Agile Manifesto and Software Craftsmanship
------------------------------------------
The late 1990s where at a historical low. More than 80% of projects were
failing. In February 2001, seventeen programmers met and discussed to come up with
four ideas.

The manifesto for agile software development means that "we are uncovering
better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through
this work we have come to value:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan.

These ideas led to techniques such as XP, Scrum, Lean, etc. TDD, SOLID, Design
Patterns erupted from the agile era. But programmers miss this idea. Software
craftsmanship never formalized until recently. In march 2009, the manifesto was
related. In pursuit of the items on the left, they have found items on the right
to be indispensable:

- Not only working software, but also **well-crafted software**
- Not only responding to change, but also **steadily adding value**
- Not only individuals and interactions, but also **community of professionals**
- Not only customer collaboration, but also **productive partnerships**
